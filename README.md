This serves as a repository to the activities I have accomplished under the course **CPE 019 entitled** "Emerging Technologies 2" surrounding the field of **Big Data Analytics**.

## Introduce Yourself
I am **Roy Carlos De Guzman**, a Computer Engineering student of the Technological Institute of the Philippines, Quezon City campus. I am pursuing the specialization track, **Cyber-Physical Systems** which involves knowledge around **Internet of Things**, **Machine Perception**, **Robotics**, and **Intelligent Systems**. Nevertheless, studying Big Data Analytics is becoming a necessity as I pursue a professional career in Computer Engineering due to its rampant growth in value and prevalence as technological devices inflate in number.
